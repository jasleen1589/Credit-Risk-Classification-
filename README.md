# Credit-Risk-Classification-
Module 20
For the Credit Risk Assignment, I used the Logistic Regression Model which helped classify loan risks based on accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
While studying this machine learning model, I realized that it is imperative to have a better understanding of how to accurately predict a loan that would have a higher risk compared to a healthy loan as that can greatly impact not just the lender but also the consumer in the long run especially if they fail to pay it back.
Factors such as acuracy, precision, and reliability all play a great role in determining the credit risk for the loan and all should be considered by the lender prior to approval of the loan.
